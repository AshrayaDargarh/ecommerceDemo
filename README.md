# ecommerceDemo - MERN Stack CRUD Operations Showcase

Welcome to the ecommerceDemo repository! This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the MERN (MongoDB, 
Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

In this demo, I have developed a basic e-commerce application, showcasing the core functionalities of a typical e-commerce platform. 
The project includes:
1. MongoDB Database: Utilizing MongoDB to store product data, user information, and other essential details required for the application.
2. Express.js Server: Building a robust backend using Express.js to handle HTTP requests, manage routes, and interact with the MongoDB database.
3. React Frontend: Implementing a responsive and user-friendly frontend using React to showcase products, enable user interactions, and demonstrate CRUD operations.
4. Node.js Environment: Setting up a Node.js runtime environment to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

The main objectives of this project are to demonstrate my proficiency in working with the MERN stack, understanding RESTful APIs, and showcasing my ability to perform CRUD operations effectively.
While this application is intended for educational purposes, it serves as a testament to my knowledge and skills in full-stack web development.
